My path to a whole hearted pursuit of a career is software engineering was a long one of many tenuous steps.  I had some exposure to coding towards the end of my time at University, in the form of an intro level CS class where I was exposed to Python. The way of thinking about problems that academic CS demands really spoke to me in a big way, however I had only taken this course in my last semester so I was not in a position to change my major or even pick up another minor, but I knew if I could this was something I'd like to explore further.

After graduation, in tandem with the job search I started trying to learn to build and building very hack-y games and animations using HTML with JS  files served directly from the file system.  I also enrolled in an online CS course on [edx](https://www.edx.org/).  Around the time at my first real job out of college I started learning through tutorials, articles and excessive searching on stackoverflow I began learning more about server-side technologies, focusing alot on Node since at the time it was very popularand the jump from client side JS to Node seemed pretty smooth.

From there I began picking up MVC frameworks like Angular and React and built some projects that Iam pretty proud of, displayed on my [profolio site](https://www.alexandercleasby.com/).  I began reaching out to people I knew in the tech space and attending a couple of meetups to talk about projects and what their jobs look like, what I could expect from a technical interview, even doing some mock interveiws.  I began applying to junior positions, but I struggled convincing myself I was ready for alot of these positions and I did not get a large volume of applications out.  Of the applications I did get out, nothing materialized for me, so I began thinking more about a little more structured program like a bootcamp.  At first I was pretty sceptical of the whole idea, but I did eventually take the plunge and enrolled in the Flatiron School.  I hope that the structure of the program will help me develop my skills and that the structure of the career services will discipline my job search.

Thanks for reading.
